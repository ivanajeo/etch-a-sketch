## How It Works
Just hover your mouse over the canvas and **watch it come to life**.  
No clicks. No mess. Just instant creative expression.

## Features
| Tool      | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Squares?` | Define the canvas grid size (e.g., 16 = 16x16). Max: **100x100**. Smaller squares = finer detail. |
| `Black`     | Set the brush color to classic **black** (default).                         |
| `Random`🌈  | Each stroke becomes a surprise — totally random colors!                    |
| `Eraser`    | Hover to erase previously painted squares.                                |
| `Clean`     | Wipe the canvas clean and start fresh.                                     |
